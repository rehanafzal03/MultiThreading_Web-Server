# ⚙️ MultiThreading Web Server (Java)

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Java-based socket server** using three different approaches to handle multiple client requests:

1. 🧵 **Single Threaded Server**
2. 🔁 **Multi Threaded Server**
3. 🧵🔁 **Thread Pool Based Server**

## 🚀 Purpose

The goal of this project is to:
- Compare the performance of different threading models under heavy traffic (e.g., 60,000 requests per minute).
- Observe how system resources behave under stress using JMeter.
- Analyze how thread management impacts stability and response time.
