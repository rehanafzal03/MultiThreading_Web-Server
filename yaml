## 🧪 Load Testing (JMeter)

- Simulated **60,000 requests/min** (≈1000 requests/sec) using **Apache JMeter**.
- The system **crashed at higher loads** due to resource exhaustion.
- Results:
  - 🧵 **Single Threaded** crashed after ~120 seconds.
  - 🔁 **Multi Threaded** handled more but still unstable under high load.
  - 🔁🧵 **Thread Pool** was relatively more stable and resource-efficient.
